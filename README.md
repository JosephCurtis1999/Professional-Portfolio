UI scrolls to a section with titled image's of the developer's applications
first application image is large than the other applications images

User Story
AS a coding bootcamp student
I wanted to build a webpage to practise and display my current skills
Over time, I will improve and add more deployable applications to this page to showcase my skills to prospective employers
The webpage starts with a heading and navigations bar
It then has a large scenic image
After this we have an About Me section with some text and an image
We then have a section of my future deployable applications with images and text
At the bottom of the page we have contact details including e-mail, phone and LinkedIn

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
